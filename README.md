# LearnPolishVerbs
This is new version of a legacy project I created several years ago in VB.
Its purpose is to support the user (me) in learning to conjugate polish verbs. Polish is an insanely complicated language.

I will attempt to apply all the best practices I have learned from Steve Smith.
In the original (VB) project I developed an algorithm to take basic information about a verb (the so-called primitive verb) and automatically derive the complete conjugation of that verb.
I hope to use TPT (Table Per Type) to store the data. Then there will be a table for the primitive verbs; the data in this table has to be meticulously entered by hand (ugh!). Then the algorithm (implemented in the Business Logic Layer BLL) will generate the complete conjugation for each verb and store it in the table for the polish verb.
I see two major hurdles to be overcome in this project:
i)  Understand my old VB-code well enough to reimplement it in C#.
ii) Remember enough polish grammar (that I have not looked at for several years) to be sure I am getting it right.
I am very grateful for the online dictionaries from leo.org - especially for the German/Polish dictionary which contains flexion tables for a large numberr of polish verbs. Without those I could never be sure I was getting it right.
